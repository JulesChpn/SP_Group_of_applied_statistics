# SP_Group_of_applied_statistics

## Context

This repository is a project that I did during my Master 1 at ENSAE Paris.

The name of the course was "Group of applied statistics" and took place between November 2022 and May 2023.

We were a group of 3 and we passed this course with 17.5/20.

## Objectives

We were supervised by Laurent Davezies from CREST.

In this project, we tried to use a statistical framework to a demographic problematic : Covid-19.

Our goal was to study over-mortality caused by Covid-19 in 2020 in France.

## How to go through our project

Our whole study is available in the PDF document.

The notebooks that are present in this repository contain the application of our statistical methodology.
- population : we import and clean population databases
- observed_mortality_ratios : we import, clean and transform databases to retrieve observed mortality ratios
- predicted_mortality_ratios : we transform dataframes to obtain predicted mortality ratios
- predicted_number_of_deaths : we predict the number of deaths in 2020 in France
